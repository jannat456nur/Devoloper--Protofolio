            <h3>Friend something better than chocolate ice cream.</h3>
            <p>Frozen is a 2013 American 3D CGI-animated musical fantasy comedy-drama film, created and produced at Walt
                Disney Animation Studios, released by Walt Disney Pictures[4] and distributed by Walt Disney Studios
                Motion Pictures. The film uses the same style as Tangled. It is loosely inspired by Hans Christian
                Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen. It is the 53rd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated
                Classics series. It also features the 12th and 13th members of the Disney Princess line-up, Anna and
                Elsa. It is the fifth film in, what is generally considered, the Disney Revival Era.</p>

                    <p>Frozen is one of Disney's fairy tales full of princesses, and as such, one might expect that most
                        Frozen-related attractions are found at Magic Kingdom's Fantasyland. However, the truth is that
                        the
                        real
                        home of Frozen at Walt Disney World is at Epcot.</p>
